  abstractNote={Music Emotion Recognition has attracted a lot of academic research work in recent years because it has a wide range of applications, including song recommendation and music visualization. As music is a way for humans to express emotion, there is a need for a machine to automatically infer the perceived emotion of pieces of music. In this paper, we compare the accuracy difference between music emotion recognition models given music pieces as a whole versus music pieces separated by instruments. To compare the models’ emotion predictions, which are distributions over valence and arousal values, we provide a metric that compares two distribution curves. Using this metric, we provide empirical evidence that training Random Forest and Convolution Recurrent Neural Network with mixed instrumental music data conveys a better understanding of emotion than training the same models with music that are separated into each instrumental source.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we solve and visualize optimal play for the Great Rolled Ones jeopardy dice game by Mitschke and Scheunemann&nbsp;[4, p. 4-5]. We share the second player advantage and compute that the first player should start with 3 compensation points (komi) for greatest fairness. We present a spectrum of human-playable strategies that trade off greater play complexity for better performance, and collectively clarify key considerations for excellent play.},
